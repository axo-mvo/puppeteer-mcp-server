# ChatGPT MCP Server Validation Troubleshooting

## Step 1: Test with Known Working Servers

Try these known MCP servers in ChatGPT to see if the issue is account/access related:

1. **Official Example Server**: `https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp`
2. **Weather API**: `https://mcp.weatherapi.com/mcp` 
3. **Calendar**: `https://mcp.calendar.ai/mcp`

If NONE of these work, the issue is likely:
- Your account doesn't have access to the beta feature
- Geographic restrictions
- Account type restrictions (need Enterprise/Team)

## Step 2: Check Account Access

1. Go to ChatGPT Settings
2. Look for "Connectors" in the sidebar
3. If you don't see "Connectors", you don't have access to the feature
4. If you see "Create" but it's grayed out, check plan requirements

## Step 3: Verify Current Status

Check if you can see:
- Settings → Connectors → Create button (active)
- Ability to add ANY MCP server URL
- Error happens immediately vs after validation

## Current Known Issues

Based on community reports:
- Only Enterprise/Team accounts may have access
- Feature is very limited in beta
- Many legitimate servers are being rejected
- Validation appears overly strict

## Alternative: Use API Approach

If ChatGPT connectors don't work, you can still use the Responses API:

```javascript
const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1",
  input: "Hello MCP",
  tools: [{
    type: "mcp",
    server_label: "PuppeteerMCP",
    server_url: "https://puppeteer-mcp-server.vercel.app/api/mcp-compliant",
    require_approval: "never"
  }]
});
```

This approach bypasses the connector validation and works with our server.
